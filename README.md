# Project 4: Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

**Project Description:**

In todays world, purchases and transactions have become reliant on digital platforms. Due to the simplicity of swiping a card or inputing a number into an online shopping cart. Thus making it harder to protect ones information. With issues such as scalablity, data privacy security, and real time detection it makes it harder for companies to detect and predict when potential fraudulent charges are being made. In an attempt to make this process easier we created a dashboard that will help card issuers better predit when a fraudulent transaction is being made.

**Dataset used:**

- Kaggle Card dataset.
- Mock data created in python. 


# Process:

There were many resources we used to develop our dashboard to make it function. From creating data to forming visualizations.
  1. Find data sources that have the nesscary information. (Date/time, Names, Transaction amounts, etc.)
  2. Creating mock data in python using pandas, sklearn, tensorflow, and vscode.
  3. Cleaning our main dataset in python using pandas.
  4. Model creation for deep learning using RNN and random forest. 
  5. Bootstrap for html and css to style and create a base model for our dashboard.
  6. Javascript dashboard creation.

# Dashboard Features: 

**Search Bar**

In place where users can search for any customer and see their card information.
Additionally the search bar stores history of searches.


**Map of transactions**

Showing places on the map where there are transactions in real time. Color coded to show green as good transactions and red as potential fraudulent charges. 


**Customer Information**

Upon searching for a card customer we can see their general card info such as their balance and their recent transactions. 

**Line and Pie charts**
